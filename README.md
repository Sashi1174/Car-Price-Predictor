# Car-Price-Predictor
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather a comprehensive dataset of used car listings, including relevant features and target prices. Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.

Feature Engineering: Identify and transform key features that significantly impact car prices. This may involve encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and creating interaction terms.

Model Development: Implement a linear regression model to predict car prices. This involves training the model on a subset of the data and tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.

Model Evaluation: Assess the model's accuracy and generalization capability using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. Perform cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.

Interpretability and Insights: Analyze the linear regression coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on the predicted car price. Provide insights into which factors are the most influential.

Deployment: Create a user-friendly interface or API where users can input car details and receive price predictions. Ensure the solution is scalable and can handle real-time queries.

Methodology
Data Collection:

Source data from reliable automotive databases, online car marketplaces, or public datasets.
Collect features such as car make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, engine size, fuel type, transmission type, and location.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing data using imputation techniques.
Remove or cap outliers to avoid skewed results.
Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Normalize or standardize numerical features.
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a linear regression model on the training data.
Perform feature selection to identify the most predictive features.
Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using the test dataset.
Calculate performance metrics (MAE, MSE, R-squared).
Use cross-validation to validate model stability.
Interpretability:

Analyze the regression coefficients to determine the impact of each feature.
Provide visualizations such as coefficient plots to aid understanding.
Deployment:

Develop a web application or API using frameworks like Flask or Django.
Implement input validation and error handling.
Ensure the system is efficient and can handle multiple requests.
